Problem
--------
You have an array of N integers.
There are M contiguous segments that are sorted within the segment, but the whole array is not sorted.
N >> M.
How to produce a sorted version of this array?

OR

Problem can also be described as merging M sorted linked lists

Sample:
    input: [{1,3,5},{2,4,6,10,20,30},{11,12,23}]
    output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,20,23,30]
