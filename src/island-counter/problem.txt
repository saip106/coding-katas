Problem
--------
Count number of islands where every island is row-wise and column-wise separated

Given a rectangular matrix which has only two possible values ‘X’ and ‘O’.
The values ‘X’ always appear in form of rectangular islands and these islands
are always row-wise and column-wise separated by at least one line of ‘O’s.
Note that islands can only be diagonally adjacent.
Count the number of islands in the given matrix.
