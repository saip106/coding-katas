We are given a string having parenthesis like below
     “( ((X)) (((Y))) )”
We need to find the maximum depth of balanced parenthesis, like 4 in above example. Since ‘Y’ is surrounded by 4 balanced parenthesis.

If parenthesis are unbalanced then return -1.

More examples:

S = "( a(b) (c) (d(e(f)g)h) I (j(k)l)m)";
Output : 4

S = "( p((q)) ((s)t) )";
Output : 3

S = "";
Output : 0

S = "b) (c) ()";
Output : -1

S = "(b) ((c) ()"
Output : -1
